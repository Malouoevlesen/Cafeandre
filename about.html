<p class="about">
Hello and welcome to our website! <br  /><br  />
Our names are Randi and André. Mother and son, both cooks with a background in good gastronomy, both from the roadway and different restaurants in the Copenhagen area. <br  /><br  />
Since November 2011 we have have been making cakes where quality and presence are at the center. <br /><br  />
The cakes change constantly. Just as you think you have found a favorite cake, we are ready with new ones to try. <br /><br  />
This is partly because we can not help it, but also that there is always something new for us to try. <br /><br  />
We make many different types of cake as well, and it's not only cheesecake or pies. Whether it's a single piece of cake or a whole cake you take with you home, we are ready. <br /><br  />

We offer both espresso coffee and filter coffee, both of delicious high quality. All beans are low in acidity. Good hot chocolate made on Belgian chocolate and milk. If you enjoy tea more, we can handle that too. <br  /><br  />

We look forward to seeing you in the cafe. <br  />
